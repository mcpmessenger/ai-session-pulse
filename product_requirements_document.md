# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Terminal Session Management Application

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) details the requirements for a multi-terminal session management application. The application aims to provide users with a robust and intuitive platform to manage and observe multiple terminal sessions, particularly those running AI code (Gemini or Claude) within Ubuntu environments. This document outlines the core functionalities, user experience considerations, architectural design, and future enhancements, serving as a guiding resource for the development team.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this application is to simplify the management and observability of multiple AI-driven terminal sessions. Key objectives include:

- **Enhanced Observability:** Provide real-time insights into the activities of individual and multiple agents.
- **Streamlined Control:** Enable users to send commands and interact with remote terminal sessions efficiently.
- **Scalability:** Design an architecture that can handle a growing number of concurrent sessions and agents.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offer an intuitive and customizable user experience, including a true black dark mode.
- **Security:** Implement robust security measures for user authentication, data protection, and credential management.
- **Extensibility:** Lay the groundwork for future integrations, such as payment processing and advanced authentication.

## 3. User Stories

To illustrate the application's functionality from a user's perspective, the following user stories are provided:

- As a user, I want to view the real-time activity of all my terminal sessions in a single dashboard, so I can monitor their progress.
- As a user, I want to filter events by application and session ID, so I can focus on specific agents or tasks.
- As a user, I want to send commands to a specific terminal session, so I can control its execution.
- As a user, I want to use voice commands to interact with the application, so I can manage sessions hands-free.
- As a user, I want a true black dark mode, so I can work comfortably in low-light environments.
- As a user, I want to securely store my credentials for external services, so I don't have to re-enter them repeatedly.
- As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account (V2), so I can access the application conveniently.
- As a user, I want to make payments for premium features (V2), so I can unlock advanced functionalities.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Session Management
- The application shall allow users to initiate and terminate multiple terminal sessions.

- The application shall enable users to send commands to specific sessions.

### 4.2. Observability
- The application shall provide a real-time stream of events from all connected agents.
- The application shall display summarized event data to provide quick insights.
- The application shall allow filtering of events by application name and session ID.
- The application shall provide access to full chat transcripts for stopped sessions.

### 4.3. User Interface
- The application shall offer a true black dark mode as a customizable theme option.
- The application shall be responsive and mobile-friendly.

### 4.4. Voice Command
- The application shall support voice input for commands using Whisper technology.
- The application shall transcribe voice commands into text and display them.

### 4.5. Credential Management
- The application shall provide a secure settings panel for users to store and manage credentials for external services.
- Stored credentials shall be encrypted at rest.

### 4.6. Authentication (Version 2)
- The application shall integrate with Google OAuth for user sign-in.

### 4.7. Payments (Version 2)
- The application shall integrate with Stripe for processing payments for premium features.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Performance
- The application shall maintain real-time event streaming with minimal latency.
- The application shall efficiently handle a large number of concurrent WebSocket connections.

### 5.2. Security
- All communication between components shall be encrypted (TLS/SSL).
- User authentication and authorization shall be robust.
- Sensitive data, including credentials, shall be securely stored and accessed.

### 5.3. Scalability
- The architecture shall support horizontal scaling of backend services and agents.
- The database shall be capable of handling increasing data volumes.

### 5.4. Reliability
- The application shall be resilient to component failures.
- Data persistence mechanisms shall ensure data integrity.

### 5.5. Usability
- The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- The dark mode shall be visually appealing and reduce eye strain.

## 6. System Architecture

(Refer to `architecture_design.md` and `architecture_diagram.png` for detailed architecture.)

The system architecture is designed around a client-server model with dedicated agents for terminal sessions, emphasizing real-time communication via WebSockets and structured inter-agent communication through the MCP protocol. Key components include:

- **Client Application (Frontend):** A web-based interface for user interaction and observability.
- **Backend Server:** The central hub for logic, data, and communication.
- **Agent (Terminal Session):** Dedicated processes for executing AI code within Ubuntu environments.
- **Database:** For persistent storage of application data and logs.
- **Credential Management System:** Secure storage for sensitive credentials.
- **Voice Command Service:** Utilizes Whisper for transcribing and processing voice commands.

## 7. MCP Protocol Integration

The Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP) will standardize communication between the Backend Server and agents, ensuring interoperability and consistent data exchange. This includes defining standardized event formats, command structures, agent registration, and heartbeat mechanisms.

## 8. MVP Team Structure

The MVP development will be executed by a three-agent team:

- **Product Manager Agent:** Defines requirements, prioritizes features, and oversees product vision.
- **Frontend Developer Agent:** Develops the client application, UI, and integrates with backend services.
- **Backend Developer Agent:** Implements server-side logic, database integration, credential management, and voice command services.

## 9. Future Considerations (Version 2)

Version 2 will focus on integrating advanced features:

- **Google OAuth:** For secure and convenient user authentication.
- **Stripe Payments:** To enable premium features and subscription models.

## 10. Open Questions and Dependencies

- Specific technologies for Backend Server implementation (e.g., Python/Flask, Node.js/Bun).
- Detailed schema for the database.
- Specific implementation details for the MCP protocol.
- Choice of UI framework for the client application.
